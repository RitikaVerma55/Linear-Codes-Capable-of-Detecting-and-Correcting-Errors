# Linear-Codes-Capable-of-Detecting-and-Correcting-Errors
Investigated various algebraic structures such as rings, ideals and Galois fields. Applied coding theory for error-detecting and error-correcting codes in communication systems. Analyzed linear block codes, generator matrices, parity-check matrices, hamming metrics and decoding techniques.
